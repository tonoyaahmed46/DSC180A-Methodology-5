**1.What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?** \
The most interesting topic in my domain so far was analyzing how agents created by a large language model respond to certain questions, depending on how you ask the question. The comprehensibility, detail, and structure of the agents answers differ greatly, depending on what language you choose to use in the phrasing of your question.
**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.** \
One interesting thing we noticed when running our agents is that no matter what opinion or argument you ask the agent, the agent will most likely agree. An interesting investigation to pursue in Quarter 2 would be to understand why this agreement occurs, and what language needs to be present for the agent to finally disagree. 
**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**\
One potential change would be to not create a new agent every time we ask the agents about a new political topic. It would be more interesting next quarter if we only built one agent, and asked it multiple questions about different topics. 
**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?** \
One technique I would like to use next quarter is to ask the agent to explain highly unpopular opinions in politics, and attempt to extract a rationale behind holding such opinions from the agent.
